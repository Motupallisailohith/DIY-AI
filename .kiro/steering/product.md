# Product Overview

This is an AI Agent Marketplace platform that provides a catalog service for managing and deploying AI agents. The system allows for:

- Agent registration and discovery through a catalog service
- Containerized AI agent deployment using Docker
- JSON Schema-based agent definitions for standardized configuration
- RESTful API for agent management and execution

The platform follows a microservices architecture with the catalog service handling agent metadata, schemas, and lifecycle management. Agents are defined using standardized JSON schemas and deployed as Docker containers with configurable resource limits and health checks.
